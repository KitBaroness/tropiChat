A nostalgic 90s-style chatroom called "TropiChat" that requires web3 wallet authentication before users can join. This implementation has all the classic elements of 90s web design:

### Retro Styling:
Animated starry background
Bright neon colors and text shadows
Comic Sans font
Blinking text and scrolling marquee
Classic layout with chat window and user list


### Web3 Authentication:
Connects to MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets
Requires wallet connection before chat access
Displays wallet address after connection
Allows users to choose a username after connecting


### Chat Features:
Colorful usernames
Mock users to simulate a busy chat environment
Simple emoji picker
Chat commands (like /help, /me, /clear)
System messages


### Nostalgic Touches:
Tropical theme with palm tree emojis
Classic "under construction" feeling
Simulated responses from other users



## To implement this on your website:
Copy this HTML file to your website's directory
Make sure your users have MetaMask or another web3 wallet installed
For a production version, you might want to add server-side functionality using WebSockets or similar technology for real-time communication.# tropiChat
